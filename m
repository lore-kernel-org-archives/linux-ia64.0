And replace private helpers with common one, see the last patch - the 
ultimate goal
would be to replace all occurrences of fetch_and_zero with __xchg.

If you mean some way of (semi-)automatic detection of such cases, then 
no. Anyway this could be quite interesting challenge.

As Alexander already pointed out, swap requires 'references' to two 
variables,
in contrast to xchg which requires reference to variable and value.
So we cannot use swap for cases:
     old_value = __xchg(&x, new_value);
