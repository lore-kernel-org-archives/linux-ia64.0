Afaict, stack_size is *only* used on ia64:

/*
 * sys_clone2(u64 flags, u64 ustack_base, u64 ustack_size, u64 parent_tidptr, u64 child_tidptr,
 *	      u64 tls)
 */
GLOBAL_ENTRY(sys_clone2)
	/*
	 * Allocate 8 input registers since ptrace() may clobber them
	 */
	.prologue ASM_UNW_PRLG_RP|ASM_UNW_PRLG_PFS, ASM_UNW_PRLG_GRSAVE(8)
	alloc r16=ar.pfs,8,2,6,0
	DO_SAVE_SWITCH_STACK
	adds r2=PT(R16)+IA64_SWITCH_STACK_SIZE+16,sp
	mov loc0=rp
	mov loc1=r16				// save ar.pfs across do_fork
	.body
	mov out1=in1
	mov out2=in2
	tbit.nz p6,p0=in0,CLONE_SETTLS_BIT
	mov out3=in3	// parent_tidptr: valid only w/CLONE_PARENT_SETTID
	;;
(p6)	st8 [r2]=in5				// store TLS in r16 for copy_thread()
	mov out4=in4	// child_tidptr:  valid only w/CLONE_CHILD_SETTID or CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID
	mov out0=in0				// out0 = clone_flags
	br.call.sptk.many rp=do_fork
.ret1:	.restore sp
	adds sp=IA64_SWITCH_STACK_SIZE,sp	// pop the switch stack
	mov ar.pfs=loc1
	mov rp=loc0
	br.ret.sptk.many rp
END(sys_clone2)

I'm not sure if this needs to be because of architectural constraints or
if it just is a historic artifact.
(Ccing ia64 now to see what they have to say.)
