Scott-

I've been using the compiler from the TurboLinux 5/5 release,
`2.9-ia64-000216-final'.  I pretty sure I've also used the
compiler from Turbo's 8/28 release also, I don't know what
version it is offhand.  If it'll help I've attached the
`.config' file that I use.  You should change it to disable
B2 specific code and enable B1 specific code but other than
that it should work.
