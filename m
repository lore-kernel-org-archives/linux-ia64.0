Right.

Huh, I wasn't aware that was an option, I'll look into that. I did scribble
down a comment next to smp_send_reschedule(), but having a decodable
function name would be better!

Ah, I was a bit unclear here - I don't care too much about the IPI type
being used, but rather being able to figure out on IRQ entry where that IPI
came from - thinking some more about now, I don't think logging *all* CSDs
causes an issue there, as you'd look at the earliest-not-seen-yet event
targeting this CPU anyway.

That'll be made easy once I get to having cpumask filters for ftrace, so
I can just issue something like:

  trace-cmd record -e 'ipi_send_cpu' -f "cpu = 3" -e 'ipi_send_cpumask' -f "cpus \in {3}" -T hackbench 

(it's somewhere on the todolist...)

TL;DR: I *think* I've convinced myself logging all of them isn't an issue -
I'm going to play with this on something "smarter" than just hackbench
under QEMU just to drill it in.
